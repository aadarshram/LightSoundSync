# LightSoundSync
This repository contains content for a project "LightSoundSync" which explores synchronizing light with sound by changing the brightness of an LED with sound level using a composite analog system. The project is a part of the Analog Systems Lab course offered at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (Summer, 2025).

## Learning outcomes
Feedback theory, open and closed loop system, stability of closed loop system, compensating an unstable sytsem, voltage and current regulation, Opamp RC integrator, Schmitt Trigger and Oscillator, Active RC filters, Summing amplifier, Peak detector and Audio amplifier.

## Brief Description
The system consists of the following main modules-
1. DC-DC converter based LED Driver
2. Bandpass Filters
3. Adder
4. Peak Detector
5. Class-D Audio Amplifier

When all the modules are connected together, we achieve the desired result. Sound can be heard over speaker driven by class-D Amplifier. The sound is typically heartbeat or lung sound derived from stethoscope and processed in electronic stethoscope module. Fixed frequency tone from audio source or function generator can also be used.

The repository will have collection of some theory on each parts of the circuit, schematic, simulation and results. The simulations are done using LTSpice.
